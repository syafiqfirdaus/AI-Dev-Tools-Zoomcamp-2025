🚀 Just completed Week 1 of the AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp by @DataTalksClub!

I built a fully functional Django TODO app from scratch using AI assistants. It was an amazing experience to see how quickly I could go from zero to a deployed app with tests.

**What I built:**
✅ Django Project & App Setup
✅ Database Models & Migrations
✅ CRUD Views & Templates
✅ Automated Tests
